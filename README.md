# Open-Source-Power-Supply
An open source benchtop power supply that's good enough for most purposes.

The case was **3D printed** using a [Monoprice Select Mini](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=15365) with wood PLA
for the front and back panels, and normal, green PLA for the top and bottom parts of the case.

## Characteristics
- **Input Voltage:** Up to 19V without fan
- **Output Voltage:** 0-12V
- **Output Current:** 0-600mA (see Note)
- Adjustable current limit

**Note:** Current can go up to 800mA by replacing the five 10 Ohm resistors with five 5 Ohm resistors. One should also double the gain of the differential amplifier in this case, so as to display voltage and current correctly.
